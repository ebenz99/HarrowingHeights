# Harrowing Heights

A GH-Pages site for our class project in Technical Writing

## Organization

All web-design files have their `.css` and `.html` files coupled by name. Images can be found in folders categorized by functional purpose within the site. The folder keys are as follows:

1. `Emp` corresponds to Employment Documents
2. `Animals` contains pictures of all directory listed animals on the site
3. `Menus` holds all restaurant menu images gathered for the site.
4. `Backgrounds` is used for all full-page background images
5. `Icons` has the small pictures used for browser tab design
6. `Maps` stores the static, topographic, and interactive map images
7. `Merch` contains the pictures of all park merchandise
8. `Tickets` holds the various tickets designed for the park opening

## Page Action Workarounds

Github Pages only provides static pages for the sites it hosts. To circumvent this, any page action seen on the Harrowing Heights site is a byproduct of Javascript or JQuery. With some work, these solutions were made to work just fine. The only major problem static pages caused me was my inability to use APIs like Firebase or Flask with Python to handle passwords. Instead, there is a single password to log into the employee section of the site: "TechnicalWritingIsCool". Specialized documents are still protected by the Box Login.

## Reflection

I feel like this was a really great class for me. Especially after it became more in the hands of the admins, I really appreciated the responsibility of being able to handle the direction of the site. Keeping everything running smoothly required being pretty proactive and communicative with the teams. Honestly, while I prefer agile software development, implementing it with this project was tough, because documents/videos would come in later than I needed them and I would have to scramble to get stuff on the site. Despite this, I would maintain that this project has been an awesome experience. I went from 0 HTML and CSS expertise to feeling like I have a healthy knowledge base in both languages, which was my personal goal for the course and a valuable skill to have in my field.

Thanks for a great semester Mr. Russo!

P.S. - Thanks also for sending me that article about esoteric coding languages. I've actually started getting into a couple of them for fun--some of it is in my "Eso-Lang" repository.
